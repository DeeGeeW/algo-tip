# Given an array of social media posts and a hash of users, return a list of posts (as an array of hashes) that replaces the submitted_by id number as the person's actual name.

# For example, given this array of posts (note that the submitted_by is an id number):

# [
# {title: 'Me Eating Pizza', submitted_by: 231, likes: 1549},
# {title: 'i never knew how cool i was until now', submitted_by: 989, likes: 3},
# {title: 'best selfie evar!!!', submitted_by: 111, likes: 1092},
# {title: 'Mondays are the worst', submitted_by: 403, likes: 644}
# ]

# And this hash of users (the key is the id number and the value is the user's real name):

# users = {403 => "Aunty Em", 231 => "Joelle P.", 989 => "Lyndon Johnson", 111 => "Patti Q."}

# Return the array of posts as follows:

# [
# {title: 'Me Eating Pizza', submitted_by: "Joelle P.", likes: 1549},
# {title: 'i never knew how cool i was until now', submitted_by: "Lyndon Johnson", likes: 3},
# {title: 'best selfie evar!!!', submitted_by: "Patti Q.", likes: 1092},
# {title: 'Mondays are the worst', submitted_by: "Aunty Em", likes: 644}
# ]
